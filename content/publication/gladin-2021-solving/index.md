abstract: In this paper, we consider two types of problems that have some similarity in their structure, namely, min-min problems and min-max saddle-point problems. Our approach is based on considering the outer minimization problem as a minimization problem with an inexact oracle. This inexact oracle is calculated via an inexact solution of the inner problem, which is either minimization or maximization problem.
