  In this paper we consider two types of problems which have some similarity in
  their structure, namely, min-min problems and min-max saddle-point problems.
  Our approach is based on considering the outer minimization problem as a
  minimization problem with inexact oracle. This inexact oracle is calculated
  via inexact solution of the inner problem, which is either a minimization or a
  maximization problem. Our main assumptions are that the problem is smooth and
  the available oracle is mixed: it is only possible to evaluate the gradient
  w.r.t. the outer block of variables which corresponds to the outer
  minimization problem, whereas for the inner problem only zeroth-order oracle
  is available. To solve the inner problem we use accelerated gradient-free
  method with zeroth-order oracle. To solve the outer problem we use either
  inexact variant of the Vaydyaâ€™s cutting-plane method or a variant of
  accelerated gradient method. As a result we propose a framework which leads to
  non- asymptotic complexity bounds for both min-min and min-max problems.
  Moreover, we estimate separately the number of first- and zeroth-order oracle
  calls which are sufficient to reach any desired accuracy.
