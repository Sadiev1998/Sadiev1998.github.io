abstract: Recently, saddle point problems have received much attention due to
  their powerful modeling capability for a lot of problems from diverse domains.
  Applications of these problems occur in many applied areas, such as robust
  optimization, distributed optimization, game theory, and many applications in
  machine learning such as empirical risk minimization and generative
  adversarial networks training. Therefore, many researchers have actively
  worked on developing numerical methods for solving saddle point problems in
  many different settings. This paper is devoted to developing a numerical
  method for solving saddle point problems in the non-convex uniformly-concave
  setting. We study a general class of saddle point problems with composite
  structure and Hölder-continuous higher-order derivatives. To solve the problem
  under consideration, we propose an approach in which we reduce the problem to
  a combination of two auxiliary optimization problems separately for each group
  of variables, outer minimization problem w.r.t. primal variables, and inner
  maximization problem w.r.t the dual variables. For solving the outer
  minimization problem, we use the Adaptive Gradient Method, which is applicable
  for non-convex problems and also works with an inexact oracle that is
  generated by approximately solving the inner problem. For solving the inner
  maximization problem, we use the Restarted Unified Acceleration Framework,
  which is a framework that unifies the high-order acceleration methods for
  minimizing a convex function that has Hölder-continuous higher-order
  derivatives. Separate complexity bounds are provided for the number of calls
  to the first-order oracles for the outer minimization problem and higher-order
  oracles for the inner maximization problem. Moreover, the complexity of the
  whole proposed approach is then estimated.
