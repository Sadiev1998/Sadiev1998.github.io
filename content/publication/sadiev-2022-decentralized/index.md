abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized, personalized
  federated learning. For centralized personalized federated learning, a penalty
  that measures the deviation from the local model and its average, is often
  added to the objective function. However, in a decentralized setting this
  penalty is expensive in terms of communication costs, so here, a different
  penalty — one that is built to respect the structure of the underlying
  computational network — is used instead. We present lower bounds on the
  communication and local computation costs for this problem formulation and we
  also present provably optimal methods for decentralized personalized federated
  learning. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical
  performance of our methods.
