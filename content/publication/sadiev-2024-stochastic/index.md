abstract: Monotone inclusions have a wide range of applications, including
  minimization, saddle-point, and equilibria problems. We introduce new
  stochastic algorithms, with or without variance reduction, to estimate a root
  of the expectation of possibly set-valued monotone operators, using at every
  iteration one call to the resolvent of a randomly sampled operator. We also
  introduce a notion of similarity between the operators, which holds even for
  discontinuous operators. We leverage it to derive linear convergence results
  in the strongly monotone setting.
