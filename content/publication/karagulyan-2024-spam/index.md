abstract: Cross-device training is a crucial subfield of federated learning,
  where the number of clients can reach into the billions. Standard approaches
  and local methods are prone to issues such as client drift and insensitivity
  to data similarities. We propose a novel algorithm (SPAM) for cross-device
  federated learning with non-convex losses, which solves both issues. We
  provide sharp analysis under second-order (Hessian) similarity, a condition
  satisfied by a variety of machine learning problems in practice. Additionally,
  we extend our results to the partial participation setting, where a cohort of
  selected clients communicate with the server at each communication round. Our
  method is the first in its kind, that does not require the smoothness of the
  objective and provably benefits from clients having similar data.
