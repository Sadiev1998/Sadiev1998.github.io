<h1>Biography</h1>

I am a PhD student working on optimization for machine learning
and federated learning at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), advised by Professor [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/).  Before that, I completed both my undergraduate and graduate degrees  in applied mathematics and physics at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/english/), where I worked under the supervision of Professor [Alexander Gasnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AmeE8qkAAAAJ&hl=en).
